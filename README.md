## Overview

The objective of this project is to build a neural network model that accurately predicts house prices based on a set of input features. The project covers:

1. Data loading and exploration.
2. Data preprocessing.
3. Neural network model building and evaluation.
4. Analysis and visualization of results.

## Dataset

The dataset comes from the [House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) on Kaggle. The data consists of:

1. **Training Data** (`train.csv`): Contains features and target labels (house prices).
2. **Testing Data** (`test.csv`): Contains features for which the house prices need to be predicted.
3. **Sample Submission** (`sample_submission.csv`): Provides a template for submitting predictions.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following:

- Python 3.7+
- Required packages listed in the [Dependencies](#dependencies) section.

### Installation

Install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Preprocessing

The preprocessing involves:

1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handling missing values.
   - Encoding categorical features using one-hot encoding.
   - Standardizing numerical features.

2. **Feature Selection**:
   - Using Lasso regression to select important features.

## Model Architecture

The neural network architecture consists of:

1. **Input Layer**: Matches the number of selected features.
2. **Hidden Layers**:
   - Three layers with 128, 64, and 32 neurons respectively, each using ReLU activation.
3. **Output Layer**: A single neuron for predicting the house price.

## Model Training

### Training

The model is trained using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function and the Adam optimizer. Early stopping is employed to prevent overfitting.

### Evaluation

The model is evaluated using the following metrics:

1. **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Measures the average magnitude of errors.
2. **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures the average squared differences between predicted and actual values.
3. **R-squared (R²)**: Indicates the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.

## Evaluation

### Training and Validation Loss

The following plots are generated to visualize the training and validation losses:

1. **Training and Validation Loss**
2. **Training and Validation Mean Absolute Error**

### Prediction and Error Analysis

The following analyses are performed:

1. **Prediction Scatter Plot**: Compares predicted and actual house prices.
2. **Prediction Error Histogram**: Shows the distribution of prediction errors.

### Final Metrics

The final performance metrics are:

1. **Training Accuracy (R²)**
2. **Testing Accuracy (R²)**
3. **Testing Mean-Squared Error**

## Dependencies

The project requires the following dependencies:

- **Python**: 3.7+
- **NumPy**: `pip install numpy`
- **Pandas**: `pip install pandas`
- **TensorFlow**: `pip install tensorflow`
- **Scikit-learn**: `pip install scikit-learn`
- **Matplotlib**: `pip install matplotlib`
